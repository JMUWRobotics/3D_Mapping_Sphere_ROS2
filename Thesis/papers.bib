  abstract = {Spherical robots have garnered increasing interest for their applications in exploration, tunnel inspection, and extraterrestrial missions. Diverse designs have emerged, including barycentric configurations, pendulum-based mechanisms, etc. In addition, a wide spectrum of control strategies has been proposed, ranging from traditional PID approaches to cutting-edge neural networks. Our systematic review aims to comprehensively identify and categorize locomotion systems and control schemes employed by spherical robots, spanning the years 1996 to 2023. A meticulous search across five databases yielded a dataset of 3199 records. As a result of our exhaustive analysis, we identified a collection of novel designs and control strategies. Leveraging the insights garnered, we provide valuable recommendations for optimizing the design and control aspects of spherical robots, supporting both novel design endeavors and the advancement of field deployments. Furthermore, we illuminate key research directions that hold the potential to unlock the full capabilities of spherical robots.},

It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate and graduate students, and is indispensable for researchers seeking a self-contained reference on control theory. Unlike most books on the subject, Feedback Systems develops transfer functions through the exponential response of a system, and is accessible across a range of disciplines that utilize feedback in physical, biological, information, and economic systems. Karl strm and Richard Murray use techniques from physics, computer science, and operations research to introduce control-oriented modeling. They begin with state space tools for analysis and design, including stability of solutions, Lyapunov functions, reachability, state feedback observability, and estimators. The matrix exponential plays a central role in the analysis of linear control systems, allowing a concise development of many of the key concepts for this class of models. strm and Murray then develop and explain tools in the frequency domain, including transfer functions, Nyquist analysis, PID control, frequency domain design, and robustness. They provide exercises at the end of every chapter, and an accompanying electronic solutions manual is available. Feedback Systems is a complete one-volume resource for students and researchers in mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.Covers the mathematics needed to model, analyze, and design feedback systems Serves as an introductory textbook for students and a self-contained resource for researchers Includes exercises at the end of every chapter Features an electronic solutions manual Offers techniques applicable across a range of disciplines},

  abstract = {Spherical mobile mapping systems are not thoroughly studied in terms of inertial pose estimation filtering. The underlying inherent rolling motion introduces high angular velocities and aggressive system dynamics around all principal axes. This motion profile also needs different modeling compared to state-of-the-art competitors, which heavily focus on more rotationally-restricted systems such as UAV, handheld, or cars. In this work we compare our previously proposed “Delta-filter”, which was heavily motivated by the sensors inability to provide covariance estimations, with a Kalman-filter design using a covariance model. Both filters fuse two 6-DoF pose estimators with a motion model in real-time, however the designs are theoretically suitable for an arbitrary number of estimators. We evaluate the trajectories against ground truth pose measurement from an OptiTrack™ motion capturing system. Furthermore, as our spherical systems are equipped with laser-scanners, we evaluate the resulting point clouds against ground truth maps available from a Riegl VZ400 terrestrial laser-scanner (TLS). Our source code and datasets can be found on github (Arzberger, 2023).},

The proposed robot is driven by a heavy pendulum covered by a fully enclosed spherical shell, which is strongly protected, amphibious, anti-overturn and has a long-battery-life. Algorithms for location and perception, planning and motion control are comprehensively designed. On the one hand, the authors fully consider the kinematic model of a spherical robot, propose a positioning algorithm that fuses data from inertial measurement units, motor encoder and Global Navigation Satellite System, improve global path planning algorithm based on Hybrid A* and design an instruction planning controller based on model predictive control (MPC). On the other hand, the dynamic model is built, linear MPC and robust servo linear quadratic regulator algorithm is improved, and a speed controller and a direction controller are designed. In addition, based on the pose and motion characteristics of a spherical robot, a visual obstacle perception algorithm and an electronic image stabilisation algorithm are designed. Finally, the authors build physical systems to verify the effectiveness of the above algorithms through experiments.},

  abstract = {Spherical robots are a format that has not been thoroughly explored for the application of mobile mapping. In contrast to other designs, it provides some unique advantages. Among those is a spherical shell that protects internal sensors and actuators from possible harsh environments, as well as an inherent rotation for locomotion that enables measurements in all directions. Mobile mapping always requires a high-precise pose knowledge to obtain consistent and correct environment maps. This is typically done by a combination of external reference sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements and inertial measurements or by coarsely estimating the pose using inertial measurement units (IMUs) and post processing the data by registering the different measurements to each other. In indoor environments, the GNSS reference is not an option. Hence many mobile mapping applications turn to the second option. An advantage of indoor environments is that human-made environments usually have a certain structure, such as parallel and perpendicular planes. We propose a registration procedure that exploits this structure by minimizing the distance of measured points to a corresponding plane. Further, we evaluate the procedure on a simulated dataset of an ideal corridor and on an experimentally acquired dataset with different motion profiles. We show that we nearly reproduce the ground truth for the simulated dataset and improve the average point-to-point distance to a reference scan in the experimental dataset. The presented algorithms are required to work completely autonomously.},
